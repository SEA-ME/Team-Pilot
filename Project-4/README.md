# **DES Project - PDC System**

Implementation of Park Distance Control System for the PiRacer


## **Project Intro**

The goal of this project is to enhance the Piracer by integrating a Park Distance Control (PDC) system, running on a Raspberry Pi (RPi) inside the head unit. The PDC system will utilize ultrasonic sensors to detect the distance between the vehicle and any obstacles, and provide an audible response to the driver. In addition, the full stack feature development will be integrated into the existing Yocto image, creating a comprehensive and fully functional system.
